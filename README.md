# python-end-to-end-portfolio-project
This project involves an end-to-end analysis of real estate property data using Python. I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover key insights into property transactions, pricing trends, and customer profiles. The analysis helps identify market patterns, such as high-demand property types.
